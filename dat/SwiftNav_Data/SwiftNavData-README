Four receivers mounted on 03 deck (? 10/01/2021)

SwiftNavData/BIOSCruise/Unit3/0001-07080.sbp
-> Written by SwiftNav receiver, including accelerometer

Hayden converted *.sbp to other formats using SBP2RINEX, now local

SwiftNavData/BIOSCruise/Unit3/0001-07080.obs
SwiftNavData/BIOSCruise/Unit3/0001-07080.nav

Hayden used RTKPOST to convert to *.pos
Hayden processed against Bermuda core station
It's NOT real-time-kinematics but differential double-differencing
with a fixed base station.

-> Probably these first two would go into GipsyX and now PRIDE
With/without companion station

For GipsyX to run these files, in the # / TYPES OF OBSERV
header line need to change C2 --> P2
This is because SwiftNav uses GPS L2C signals
which GipsyX does not support

See support page: https://support.swiftnav.com/support/solutions/articles/44001907895-sbp-to-rinex-converter-and-data-post-processing

Hayden obtained these additional files, just other formats

SwiftNavData/BIOSCruise/Unit3/0001-07080.cnav
SwiftNavData/BIOSCruise/Unit3/0001-07080.gnav

-> So far, these haven't been used

Let's begin with the Jacksonville dockside data for a sanity check

--> Unit 2 data is no good, the data are not sampled every second

--> Each unit contains 168 hours of data, working to break trip into
    sections (travel to test site, campaign mode, travel home, etc)

    First 18 hours: Jacksonville
